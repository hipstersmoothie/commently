`commently` is a package for leaving comments on a GitHub PR from CI. However, what makes `commently` different is that it will update the same comment and keep a history over time. This allows less noise on PRs, and also a way for users to references prior automation.

An example of a use case for `commently` is preview releases. If your project does a preview build, you can use `commently` to publish a comment to GitHub with the preview version and instructions for your users on how they can test.

## Installation

```
yarn add commently-cli --dev
```

Alternatively, you can run via `npx`

```
npx commently-cli
```

## Usage

```
yarn commently
